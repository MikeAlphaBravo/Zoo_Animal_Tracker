# _Zoo Animal Tracker_
-------------------

#### _Using Angular to build an animal tracking software for a zoo, 10.27.2017_

#### By _Michael A. Brooks_

## Description

_Create an app using Angular to give zoo employees access to animal lists as well as updating data._

## Specs

* _As a user I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
* _I want to view a list of animals I have logged._
* _I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older)._
* _I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers._
